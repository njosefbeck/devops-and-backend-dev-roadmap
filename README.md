# Backend Developer & DevOps Roadmap Progress

This repository's purpose is to track my progress through the [Backend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) & [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops). Taking on this challenge is important for me to ensure I have a thorough understanding of backend and devops-related subjects. I'll also be using the Go programming language, which is new to me.

See the issues to follow along with my progress.
